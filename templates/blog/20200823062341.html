<h2> Why Perl is believed to be hated-is Perl a legacy? </ h2>

Answer the question "Is Perl a legacy?" I'll also talk to those who have searched for "why Perl is disliked". Recently (July 1-15, 2021, still visible), Google search engines have been raised to the top of Perl's related keywords for "Why Perl is disliked". In Japan, Google, which has 92% of the search engine share, has listed "Why Perl is disliked" in public spaces as the most relevant of all keywords.

<h3> Why is Perl believed to be legacy? </ H3>

From here, the first question is. Why did you search for the words Perl and Legacy?

You probably searched for it because you read it in an article somewhere or heard it from someone.

When you try the language Perl, you are worried about "What is the future of Perl?" And "What is the trend of Perl?", So are you searching?

From the Perl side, it's not badly described as legacy, so it was popularized by non-Perl users.

Perl is often used as Owakon, Perl is old, and Perl is over.

<h3> Why Perl is believed to be hated </ h3>

Recently (July 1-15, 2021, still visible), Google search engines have been raised to the top of Perl's related keywords for "Why Perl is disliked". Google, which has 92% of the search engine share, has listed "Why Perl is disliked" in public spaces as the most relevant of all keywords.

Google's search engine algorithms are working to further encourage prejudice against Perl. Google's search engine algorithm is generic, so it applies to other keywords as well, and if this is the "reason why XX people are disliked", it's dangerous.

The reasons why Perl is believed to be disliked are described below.

<h3> Perl is the original modern dynamic language </ h3>

Perl is the very first programming in a modern, dynamically typed language, and contains many original implementations.

Perl was created with reference to C, Lisp, shell scripts, and natural language. Incorporating and combining the original features of these languages ​​into the language, new programming was invented, the ancestor of modern dynamic programming. That's Perl.

The new combination of reference language features in Perl's functionality was so innovative and so good that it was widely adopted in other languages.

Programs that can be written from the beginning of a file, can be executed without compilation, dynamic variable types, dynamic and associative arrays exist as language features, variable-length strings, variable expansion, garbage collection, one The modern dynamic languages ​​used, such as liners, modules and CPAN, C language extensions, and free program community events, are Perl and features from Perl-referenced languages.

〇〇 Languages ​​are very easy to understand, very easy to use, and most of the functions that are said to be for beginners are from Perl and Perl-based languages.

<h3> Negative Campaign for Perl </ h3>

Perl was so good that there is only a negative campaign to deny Perl. Extensive low-quality marketing has been done to make impressions and keep users from touching Perl.

<h4> An example of a negative campaign </ h4>

"The GC of Perl's reference count is a toy. It's not a GC."

"Perl is a write-down language that can't be maintained once it's written"

"Programs are read a lot, so you should write them in an easy-to-read language." (I've never said Perl is hard to read)

"I developed it in Perl and it became unmaintainable."

"I can't read it when I write it in Perl"

"It's better to get people together if you're recruiting in XX languages ​​than if you're recruiting in Perl."

"Perl to 〇〇"

"The Perl core source code is the worst source code I've seen."

Explain the scripting language and write "A, B, C, D", and do not include only "Perl" in the natural context as an explanation. Major media will continue this repellent for 10 years. (Thorough disregard is just harassment)

"The future of Perl is ☆ 2, 〇〇 is ☆ 5"

"Why do I need to use Perl now when I have a language that is better than Perl?" (I've never said from Perl that there is a language that is better than Perl) (Past Great guys say there are no silver bullets in programming languages)

"I'm worried because Perl doesn't have corporate support. I'm relieved because XX has corporate support."

(Did you think about the possibility of being acquired?)

"Only elementary school students can add a semicolon at the end."

"Let's forget about Perl"

"Die Perl"

"Kill Perl"

"You shouldn't include Perl in your shell script. Like, like, 300."

"The sense of choosing the word eval for exception handling in Perl is crap."

"Perl is not a trend"

(Actually in front of me) "I have a lot of work in XX languages, but I'll show you an introductory book in XX languages."

(Ah, I'm a Perl professional ...)

"Is it okay to do Perl?" (With a surprised expression)

(Only Perl came to the bulletin board of the topic) "Is Perl still used? Nowadays, most of the languages ​​are adopted." (The content is a lie)

(When bad stats appear in Perl) "Perl is the lowest ranking ever" (On the other hand, good stats are not evaluated. Linux / Unix adoption, light users, average salary, etc.)

(The actual increase in ranking is also largely due to trend spam, search engine spam, and social spam.)

"○○ language is a language that should be learned ~, Perl is a language that should not be learned anymore ~"

Hiroyuki "Now it's in XX languages. Perl users will be gone by 2020."

"Perl is written in prison"

"To start learning Perl, you have to do ecstasy (drugs) first."

"Perr should be ruthlessly destroyed"

Stack Overflow "2017, No. 1 in the hated programming ranking Perl" (Why is the question site conducting a survey that produces such hate?)

"TIOBE Perl lowest ranking ever" (You can get a high ranking by doing a wide range of TIOBE ranking strategies and polluting the search results.)

"Perl is a nightmare."

"Perl is cancer."

"The Perl core development team is like arsenic driving Perl to suicide."

Numerous negative impression manipulation campaigns against Perl that pollute the environment of the human mind have been widespread.

<h4> Who is leading the negative campaign </ h4>

The core of the negative campaign is "Internet media" and "Companies that dominate the Internet media".

"Internet media dominance companies" outsource positive advertising for their products to a wide range of external advertising companies at a cost of billions of dollars. Outsourced companies also outsource advertising work to subcontractors.

Make news media pick up articles without showing that there is financial cooperation, google trend rise, TIBOE rank rise, stackoverflow rank rise, make it stand out in search engine search results, make it stand out with related keywords of google search, search Make your product appear when you enter keywords halfway through the window, write positive opinions in social comments, like a lot on SNS, and your company without telling your intentions at other community events Make the product word-of-mouth.

Eventually, weak and low-paying freelancers will spread acclaimed articles about their products and negative campaigns for competing products on the Web.

There is a back side to too many likes that look unnatural on the Web.

For that reason, we will hear and hear negative evaluations from the surroundings for Perl, which is excellent in product quality.

Of course, there is a feeling that I do not want to choose Perl because of the natural brand consciousness as a human mind.

For example, it's a natural brand selection, such as "He's wearing Nike shoes, so I'll choose New Balance shoes."

However, be aware that malicious intent is intentionally scattered on the Web in order to induce the illusion of natural emotions.

<h3> What is the current state of Perl? </ H3>

I will write about the current state of Perl.

<h4> Text processing in Unix / Linux server management </ h4>

Perl is a widely used programming language in the field of text processing in Unix / Linux server management.

Perl is used as an auxiliary script for debian Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu and Debian, and as an auxiliary tool for middleware such as openssh and git, so it is installed on most Linux / Unix.

In the minimum configuration, there are operating systems such as CentOS and Red Hat that do not include Perl, but since middleware is almost essential in modern web development environments, you can think that Perl is installed first. prize.

Perl has few differences between versions, and even if you are in the field on a lesser-known Unix / Linux-based OS, Perl allows you to write programs with exactly the same description. Perl programs work in the same way on AIX and Solaris.

Surprisingly, Perl continues to support character codes on general-purpose machines called EBCIDIC, so you can use Perl when processing character codes on general-purpose machines.

<h4> A certain share in web development </ h4>

Perl also has a certain market share in web development.

The Web communicates over HTTP. As long as the protocol specifications are met, any programming language can be used, so there is a great variety of programming languages ​​in the field of web development. Competition is fierce, and it is an area where negative campaigns and competition to increase market share are likely to take place.

HTTP is basically a textual protocol.

Since Perl is the most suitable field for text processing on Linux / Unix servers, it is also excellent in performance and ease of programming in HTTP communication that naturally occurs on Linux / Unix servers, that is, Web development.

The capabilities of the web framework will not be inferior to other programming languages ​​in 2020, and the excellent text processing characteristics of the Perl programming language will be used to greatly improve performance and simplicity of writing. ..

Another feature of Perl is that it is easy to support real-time Web such as realizing push notification with WebSocket.

If you want to run a VM on a cloud server that is trending in 2020,Since the layers are loosely coupled, the Perl + Web framework is also easy to do in this respect.

In addition, even if you choose on-premises or VPS in terms of system cost and quality, you can quickly migrate the configuration that was running on the cloud server.
